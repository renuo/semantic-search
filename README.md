# Semantic Search Plugin for Redmine

This Redmine plugin enables AI-based semantic search functionality using OpenAI embeddings and PostgreSQL's pgvector extension. It allows users to search for tickets using natural language queries rather than exact keyword matches.

## Features

- Semantic search across issue content (subject, description, comments, time entries)
- Vector similarity search using OpenAI embeddings
- Background processing for embedding generation
- Role-based access control (Developer and Manager roles)
- Compatible with Redmine 5.1.x and 6.0.x

## Requirements

- Redmine 5.1.x or 6.0.x
- PostgreSQL 12+ with pgvector extension installed
- Ruby 3.2.x
- Valid OpenAI API key

## Installation

### Pre-requisities

You must have an up-to-date Redmine instance available locally:

```bash
g clone git@github.com:redmine/redmine.git
cd redmine
cp config/database.example.yml database.yml
```

Make sure to configure `database.yml` to use PostgreSQL, and not MySQL.

For example:

```yaml
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: redmine
  host: localhost
  username: postgres
  password: "postgres"
  encoding: unicode

development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: redmine_development
  host: localhost
  username: postgres
  password: "postgres"
  encoding: unicode

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: redmine_test
  host: localhost
  username: postgres
  password: "postgres"
  encoding: unicode
```

### 1. Install PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension

On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install postgresql pgvector
```

### 2. Enable the extension in your database

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

### 3. Install the plugin

From your Redmine installation directory:

```bash
cd plugins
git clone https://github.com/renuo/redmine-semantic-search.git semantic_search
cd ..
bundle install
RAILS_ENV=production bin/rake redmine:plugins:migrate
```

### 4. Set up the OpenAI API key

Configure your environment variableby copying `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

### 5. Restart your Redmine application

```bash
touch tmp/restart.txt # or just ctrl-c and rerun
```

## Configuration

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Go to Administration > Plugins
3. Click "Configure" next to the Semantic Search plugin
4. Adjust settings as needed

## Usage

1. Ensure your user has a Developer or Manager role in at least one project
2. Click on "Semantic Search" in the top menu
3. Enter a natural language query (e.g., "Issues about login problems with the mobile app")
4. View the results ordered by semantic relevance

## How It Works

1. The plugin creates embeddings for issues when they are created or updated
2. Embeddings are stored in a separate database table using pgvector
3. When a search is performed, the query is converted to an embedding
4. PostgreSQL's vector similarity search finds the most semantically similar issues
5. Results are filtered based on user permissions

## Development

Once you have setup the Redmine Instance with

## Testing

> **Note 📒**: Make sure you are in Redmine's root directory before running the tests

The tests are written with MiniTest, the default testing framework for Ruby on Rails.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:test NAME=semantic_search
```

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and testing:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs linting and syntax checks on every push and pull request
- **Test Workflow**: Sets up a complete Redmine environment and runs all plugin tests

To run the workflows locally, you can use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

### GitHub Secrets

The test workflow requires the following GitHub secret to be configured:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: A valid OpenAI API key for testing embedding functionality
